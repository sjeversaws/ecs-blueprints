# What is ECS Blueprints

ECS Blueprints are terraform templates that you can deploy into your AWS account that meant to give new users a jumpstart and enable them to learn-by-doing. The blueprints are designed to demonstrate best practices for common, well-defined architectural patterns. The blueprints provide end-to-end solutions for scenarios addressing CI/CD, observability, security, and cost efficiency.

The blueprints are meant to be used as a starting point to gain understanding and proficiency but you should not expect to maintain any conformity with them. Adapt the modules by modifying them and extending them to suit your individual needs.
